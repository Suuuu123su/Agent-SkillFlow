# Native cross-model novelty and study review

Repo: /workspace/scratch/1380be55b36d/Agent-SkillFlow

Read ../NOVELTY.md, ../witnesses/README.md, and any existing ../evidence_pilot/PLAN.json and experiments/evidence_recovery_pilot source. The user authorized fixing the HIAA 13/15 cohort bug and testing additional contributions. This is a bounded offline pilot, not authorization to manufacture positive findings or claim natural-language truth.

Questions: Is the proposed missing-evidence identifiability/recovery contribution distinguishable from the listed prior work? What is the closest prior work and verifiable delta? Are the experiments vulnerable to label leakage, self-dependence, incomparable budgets, in-sample tuning, correlated samples, or incorrect certainty? Give specific minimum fixes and calibrated claim wording. Do not change experiment files or run model experiments. You may inspect code and published sources read-only. Write REVIEW.md in this directory. We use native collaboration gpt-5.6-sol/xhigh because the specified Codex MCP reviewer is unavailable; name this fallback explicitly and do not call it the unavailable tool.

=== NOVELTY VERDICT LIMITS (these bound how you judge, never how widely you search) ===
Search exhaustively; judge calibrated. Two failures waste months equally:
passing an idea a published paper already contains, and killing a viable idea
because the territory has neighbors.
1. Proximity is information, not a verdict. Someone working nearby goes in the
   report; it is not by itself a reason to reject.
2. ABANDON has exactly one qualification: a specific published paper already
   contains this result — name that paper. No named paper, no ABANDON.
3. Crowded-but-deltaed is PROCEED: state the delta in one sentence a reviewer
   could verify. Thin or contested delta is PROCEED WITH CAUTION — say what
   would make it carry, not why it should die. CAUTION is not a safe middle:
   if you cannot name the specific thing that makes the delta thin, the
   verdict is PROCEED.
4. Concurrent or competing work is not a veto. That is a race — report it and
   let the user decide whether to run it.
5. A direct attack on a central problem is legitimate novelty when nobody has
   executed it well. "This area is hot" does not mean "this area is taken."
6. This check is an early gate, never the last one — more triage, pilots, or
   external review still stand between any idea and a paper, whatever order
   this run uses. A wrongly passed idea dies cheaply at one of them; a wrongly
   killed idea is never seen again. When torn between two verdicts, choose the
   more permissive one.
Say plainly when an idea clears the check. Do not manufacture overlap.
